# S&P 500 Forecasting

The S&P 500 Market Index is analysed using popular statistical models such as SARIMA, ETS and GARCH. Additionally, a powerful open source forecasting package from Facebook, called Prophet, is also explored and used to generate forecasts.

Here a combination of the 2 models (ARMA and GARCH) is used to model the S&P 500 Returns. First the ARMA model is used to fit the Returns, and later the residuals generated by the ARMA model are modeled using the GARCH model
